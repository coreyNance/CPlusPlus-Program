# CPlusPlusProgram


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project had to do with creating a zoo program that is able to take in animal data and store it for later use.  The spec sheet says that you have already been given the     java portion of the code but they want you to use C++ for the user interface.  They want to be able to add animal data with checks in place for user error, then be able to       easily store and manage the date, then be able to store that data in a file for access later.

What did you do particularly well?

  Overall this project was very rough for me.  But I would say that I did a the addAnimal function very well.  After coming off my last project, I came into this one with alot     of confidence thinking that I was going to be able to just get right through this one.  I was beyond wrong, once I read through everything and tried to plan out the project, I   was completely lost on what to do.  I knew some about derived classes but didnt realize how little I actually knew.  Once I started creating my classes, thats when I started     to have a plan on how to do the addAnimal function.  Even though I later read about a different easier way to make this function, I believe my way ended up being a little       more effecient.  Due to my skill level, there is still a ton I need to learn though.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  Im actually not partiurally happy with my code and for that reason I believe there is alot I can still do to inhance this code alot better.  For starters I think with my         addAnimal function I would be able to come up with a more efficient way to be able to store the animal values.  Then from there, I could access those values.  I will figure it   out.  I also got the data to be saved but I think I may be able to save that data in a better format than it is now.  Also my remove animal function, I was only able to figure   out how to remove by element number instead of track number.  

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

  I found this entire code challenging, every which way I turned, I had a huge wall to climb.  I knew it from the beginning when I couldnt get it to work properly on my local     IDE and the school IDE kept freezing on me and deleting information that I thought I saved.  Once I got over that wall then came the add animal funcion and trying to get the     classes to work with pointers.  I had some luck with the program but I still feel like there more wholes in this program than the streets of Boston.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I definitly have a ton of skills form this project that I can carry over.  First skill I gained was setting up derived classes and how they work.  I also didnt know that I can close certain files when I am not using them but the main file can still interact with it.  I also didnt really understand pointers but I now undertand exactly what a pointer is.  I also got a better understanding of how to access a vector over just creating one.  The last skill that I became very much more experienced in working with functions.  Even though this course is done with, I will still learn alot about programming once I fix what I find as wholes in the program.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

What I did to make this program maintainable is by putting all the program workings into functions. Each function varies in difficulty reading but with my inline and header type of commenting, that will help greatly with readability and I would say the class system with the .h files and with the cpp files being able to work with the functions make the program adaptable.  But There is still more work to be done.
